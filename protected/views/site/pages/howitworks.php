    <h1>What is Kowop?</h1>
    <p>You know those neighborhood cork boards, where people post classes and activities (among other things) around your 'hood? We're that, but online.</p>
    <p>Kowop makes it really simple to find classes and activities you've always wanted to take. We make it really simple to find classes and activities you've never thought about taking, but so close and convenient you'll run out of excuses not to. There's no rules or restrictions on what people can offer. The quirker the better.</p>
    <p>We also make it ridiculously easy to post your class or experience. In the immortal words of one of our rotisserie chicken machine heros, you just "set it and forget it". You post once, and it stays available for as long as you'd like. We handle payments for you. You can even manage scheduling right on Kowop.</p>
    <p>Unlike many sites, we welcome anyone and everyone to post with us. If you're an individual or business who has a local class or activity you'd love to share, share on Kowop. It's 100% free to post, so why not.</p>
