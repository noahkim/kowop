            <h5>What is Kowop?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>You know those neighborhood cork boards, where people post classes and activities (among other things) around your 'hood? We're that, but online.</p>
                <p>Kowop makes it really simple to find classes and activities you've always wanted to experience, as well as ones you've never thought about taking, but so close and convenient you'll run out of excuses not to. There's no rules or restrictions on what people can offer. The quirker the better.</p>
                <p>We also make it ridiculously easy to post your experience, like pinning a paper on a board. In the immortal words of one of our rotisserie chicken machine heros, you just "set it and forget it". You post once, and it stays available for as long as you'd like. We handle payments for you. You can even manage scheduling right on Kowop.</p>
                <p>Unlike many sites, we welcome anyone and everyone to post with us with no prerequisites. If you're an individual or business who has a local class or activity you'd love to share, share on Kowop. It's 100% free to post, so there's nothing to lose.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>Do you screen or curate the available classes or activities on Kowop?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>No, Kowop is an open marketplace just like your local neighborhood board at the grocery store. We leave it up to you, the community, to leave feedback and let the rest of your neighbors know if something is awesome or not. Classes and activities who aren't holding up their end of the deal will naturally be weeded out by the community.</p>
                <p> That being said, if you attend a class or activity and have a really bad experience, please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us so we can take care of you. Also, if your offering goes against our posting guidelines, we reserve the right to blast it into oblivion (in the most friendly way possible).</p>
            </div>
            <h5>I'm not a business, just little ol' me, but I'd like to host an activity or be an instructor, what do I need to do?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>If you want to post on Kowop, we don't make you jump through flaming hoops and spiked hurdles. Just take 5 minutes and dooeeet! You don't need anyone's permission. If you don't have any experience, awesome! All we ask is that you have the knowledge and passion for whatever experience you want to share. Be creative, be honest, be yourself, and try it out. You may be surprised how many people are open to what you have to share.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>How are you different then a "meetup"?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>A meetup is more of a "let's get together" type of event, primarily organized by individuals and meeting for the sake of meeting. While individuals are encouraged to offer classes and activities on Kowop, we also help you discover local businesses who provide great classes and activities year round. Kowop also handles the transaction directly between host and attendee, making the whole process fast and easy.</p>
                <p>While we love (and encourage) free classes &amp; activities, Kowop is a great platform to directly monetize off of the experience you're providing.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, on Kowop, the experience being offered is always crafted by a business or individual who's motivated to give you an awesome experience and make you happy. You'll never find a random networking event with no real focus and people just walking around handing out business cards. (Zing!)</p>
            </div>
            <h5>How are you different then Groupon/Living Social?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>Because of their nature as a "deals" site, their offers expire. Kowop's classes and activities stay available as long as you'd like, so you stay visible year round. As an individual or business on Kowop, posting your offering is 100% free. When people do sign up, we (Kowop) tip ourselves much... much....much....much.....much..... MUCH less then these deal sites. That means more money in your pocket even when you charge promotional pricing.</p>
                <p>Also, normal people (individuals, not businesses) like you and me who want to teach or provide a neat experience are more then welcome to post on Kowop (and able to make a tidy sum of $$$ on the side, if I do say so myself). We're an open marketplace driven by the culture and demands of the neighborhood.</p>
                <p>Last but not least, Kowop is just as much about meeting new friends &amp; socializing as it is about classes &amp; activities. When you meet awesome people, connect on Kowop so there's always a friendly face at your next experience.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>How are you different from Skillshare or Udemy?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>Udemy and Skillshare are primarily for online classes. While Skillshare does have a small offering of offline courses, Kowop is all about the experience, not just about the learning. That's why a large part of Kowop is activity-based.</p>
                <p> People go to learning sites to learn something specific. People come to Kowop for that too, but also to do something fun on a Saturday afternoon when they're bored, or have guests in town, or just want to impulsively try something new and meet other locals.</p>
                <p>Kowop is also about sharing things that may be a bit off-beat, but no less valuable. Things that could never be effectively taught or experienced online, or even in a traditional "class" setting. Wood-working, fixing a car, pop-up restaurants, a guided mountain bike tour of Los Angeles... the sky's the limit.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>How are you different from a tutoring site?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>For starters, we don't ask for nearly as much as most tutoring sites, which commonly range from 20-40%. Also, tutoring usually implies 1 on 1. At Kowop, we encourage classes (at least 2 people). This helps tutors teach more efficiently, and make more moolah. It also helps attendees socialize &amp; learn in a more comfortable group setting.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>Do you love children?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>Glad you asked. Being parents ourselves, we actually love most kids. Which is why we created <a href="kowop_kids.html">Kowop Kids</a>. As parents, we know how hard it is to keep your rascal busy every day and/or weekend. That's why we made it easy for parents to search for classes and activities specficially catered to kids, and filtered by age appropriateness.</p>
                <p>Sure you can go to the same old playground or the farmers market to distract them, but when you need a crafted experience today, designed specifically for your young one, Kowop makes it easy to find and book it.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>Do you allow online classes?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>Nope. Kowop is about neighborhoods, and hanging out with locals. We also believe the best way to experience new things is hands on with a host who aims to please.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>Do you charge to post on Kowop?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>Absolutely not. It's free to post for both individuals and businesses.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>So how much do you charge?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>We only make money if you make money. It's free to post, but when someone signs up for your class or activity, we tip ourselves 15%.</p>
